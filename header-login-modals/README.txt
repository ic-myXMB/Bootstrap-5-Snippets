Bootstrap 5 Header Signin and Signup Modals Snippet uses:

Font Awesome v6.1.1

Light Switch v0.1.4

JQuery v3.6.0

JQuery Validate v1.19.3

Bootstrap v5.2


 This Bootstrap 5 Snippet demo shows how to: use Font awesome 6, Bootstrap 5 and a Bootstrap 5 example header to then use the JQuery-validation plugin and multiple modals for login and registration while also then adding a collapsed view terms section on each signin and signup modals. This also has remember me for login form and form reset for both modal forms. This also integrates light switch for light / dark mode.
