Bootstrap 5 Dashboard Tabs & Tables Snippet uses:

Font Awesome v6.3.0

Light Switch v0.1.4

JQuery v3.6.0

Bootstrap v5.3.0-alpha1

Bootstrap 5 tabs plugin

DataTables & DataTables responsive plugin


 This demo shows simply how to use Font Awesome 6.3.0, Bootstrap 5 with Bootstrap Tabs plugin, dataTables and dataTables responsive plugin to make a simple one page responsive control panel mockup using multiple tables. This also implements Light Switch as a basic light / dark mode setup but my free time was limited so I did not tweak it much, so, as such there may need to be further styling tweaks made to such if so desired...
